“Viva Garibaldi!” sang a young Italian boy in an uptown street. He held a battered violin
that looked as if it had been used for generations. The young singer was twelve years old, but
small for his age. In spite of the dirt, his face was strikingly handsome, especially when he
smiled. He was always smiling in spite of hardships, which were many in his life. Phil had been
wandering the streets, singing and playing for two hours. However, he had not received a penny.
He was about to change his position when the basement door of one of the houses
opened, and a servant came out. “My young master wants to hear you play on your fiddle,” said
the servant. “He’s sick, and can’t come out.” Phil followed through the giant house up to the
parlor where the sick boy sat. The little fiddler, who had never been invited into a fine house
before, looked with admiration at the handsome furniture. He knew that this could be a moment
that changed his life.
