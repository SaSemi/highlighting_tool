During the spring of 1858, a well-to-do farmer of western New York whittled a spiral
screw-propeller to help traverse the Erie Canal, one of the most important waterways that
connected Lake Erie to the Hudson River. This screw-propeller allowed him to conveniently ship
goods throughout the midwest of the United States. Soon after, this farmer contracted for a boat
to be built that would be powered by steam. Although advised by his builders to substitute the
common four-bladed propellers from older versions of boats, he stuck to his original design.
With one propeller at either side of the rudder—called "twin-propellers"—the boat was
ready for use. This boat is now known as the Charles Wack. The following season of 1859 was
the most active year the Erie Canal has ever known in regard to steam. The Charles Wack was
sold to Mr. Prosser, who took out the original propellers, and substituted a modern propeller. This
doubled its engine capacity.
